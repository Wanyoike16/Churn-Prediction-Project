# PowerCo Customer Churn Analysis
BCG Data Science & Analytics Virtual Experience Project

This project was completed as part of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Data Science Job Simulation on Forage.
The client, PowerCo, is a major gas and electricity utility serving small and medium-sized enterprises. Recently, they've experienced a significant uptick in customer churn ‚Äî where customers leave for competing energy providers.

To address this, BCG was engaged to:

      Diagnose the drivers of churn
      
      Investigate price sensitivity as a key factor
      
      Provide data-driven recommendations to reduce customer attrition

üß† Project Hypothesis
Hypothesis: Churn is significantly driven by customers‚Äô sensitivity to price changes.

In order to validate this, we need to:

      Model the likelihood of churn
      
      Evaluate the impact of price changes on that likelihood

üóÉÔ∏è Data Requirements
The following datasets were essential for analysis:

Dataset	Description
    Customer Data	Characteristics of each client (e.g., industry, historical electricity consumption, tenure)
    Churn Data	Labels indicating whether each customer has churned
    Historical Price Data	Electricity and gas pricing for each customer over time
