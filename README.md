# PowerCo Customer Churn Analysis
BCG Data Science & Analytics Virtual Experience Project

This project was completed as part of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Data Science Job Simulation on Forage.
The client, PowerCo, is a major gas and electricity utility serving small and medium-sized enterprises. Recently, they've experienced a significant uptick in customer churn — where customers leave for competing energy providers.

To address this, BCG was engaged to:

      Diagnose the drivers of churn
      
      Investigate price sensitivity as a key factor
      
      Provide data-driven recommendations to reduce customer attrition

🧠 Project Hypothesis
Hypothesis: Churn is significantly driven by customers’ sensitivity to price changes.

In order to validate this, we need to:

      Model the likelihood of churn
      
      Evaluate the impact of price changes on that likelihood
